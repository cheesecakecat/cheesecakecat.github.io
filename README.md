# cheesecakecat's corner

This is my personal site. Just a cozy space where I post stuff and things.

## Running locally

1. Get ruby and bundler
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Check `localhost:4000`

## Tweaking stuff

- CSS is in `assets/css/style.css`
- Main layout in `_layouts/default.html`
- Blog posts go in `_posts` (format: `YYYY-MM-DD-whatever.md`)
